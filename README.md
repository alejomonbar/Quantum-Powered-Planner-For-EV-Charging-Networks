# QUANTUM-POWERED PLANNER FOR EV CHARGING NETWORKS
## Greening the road ahead: Charging demand location model for sustainable electric vehicle adoption.
Quantum computers based on neutral atoms have introduced novel approaches to solving complex problems in combinatorial optimization. While many applications focus on encoding problems as maximal independent set (MIS) formulations, these devices can handle even more challenging tasks by utilizing the Rydberg blockade mechanism, allowing us to address non-linearities in problem formulations.



This quantum methodology aligns perfectly with our objective of optimizing the electric vehicle (EV) charging network (EVCN) within urban environments. These settings present complex challenges, where multiple factors, including population density, traffic patterns, existing infrastructure, and EV adoption rates, introduce non-linear complexities into the equation.



Our solution builds upon this foundation, by harnessing Pasqal's quantum computing technology, our approach seeks to efficiently resolve the complexities of charging station placement in urban settings, leveraging the power of quantum annealing techniques in neutral atoms architectures to determine the optimal solution effectively. 

We have shown the results of the EVCN problem for the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) for instances up to 13 qubits. We present results for 5 random instances of each problem size. The results are encouraging as the probability of finding the 5 best solutions to each problem is above a quadratic speedup without deep finetuning.


This platform is highly adaptable and can be tailored to any complex local context where users provide input data. In doing so, it contributes significantly to the transition toward a net-zero emission transport economy, addressing sustainable urban mobility challenges on a broader scale.
